## Intro
Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework developed by Twitter (X) directed as responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS and JavaScript design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components. 

In this project, I was given an HTML file as a template, and tasked to use different bootstrap methods to adjust the appearance of the web page. 

This project uses Bootstrap version 4.4.1
