## Intro
JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. I've found comparing the web page to a human body can differentiate on what the components can do. In the context of a person, HTMl is the bones, CSS is the skin and hair, and Javascript is the brain and muscle.

This Directory is a warm up on Javascript to get started on larger projects. 


## Learning Objectives

1. **What is lexical scoping in JavaScript**

2. **What is closure in JavaScript, and how do you use it?**

3. **How to chain different closures, and how to simulate private methods with Closure**

4. **The execution stack order with JavaScript**
   
5. **How to use callbacks**
