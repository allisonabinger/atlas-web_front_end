## Intro
JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. I've found comparing the web page to a human body can differentiate on what the components can do. In the context of a person, HTMl is the bones, CSS is the skin and hair, and Javascript is the brain and muscle.

This Directory is a warm up on Javascript to get started on larger projects. 


## Learning Objectives

1. **What is lexical scoping in JavaScript**

2. **What is closure in JavaScript, and how do you use it?**

3. **How to chain different closures, and how to simulate private methods with Closure**

4. **The execution stack order with JavaScript**
   
5. **How to use callbacks**

## Highlighted Javascript Mechanics


(Used Bootstrap README as template. Need to update these from Bootstrap to JS)



## [JavaScript Lexical Scoping](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_scope.asp)

Lexical scoping is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that determines the scope of a variabled based on its location within the source code. It is how variable names are resolved during runtime based on where they are declared. Scope refers to the context in which variables are accessible. Before ES6, they were either global or local. ES6 introduced block scope, which is provided using the keywords `let` and `const`. Variables declared inside a `{ }` block cannot be accessed from outside the block, unless they use the `var` keyword. 

### Example
```
{
	let x = 2;
}

(x cannot be used here)
```
```
{
	var x = 2;
}

(x CAN be used here)
```
